# SCLOrkPieces

This repository contains complete materials for pieces that SCLOrk has performed over the years. It also includes some teaching demos and examples.
SCLOrk is the Santa Clara Laptop Orchestra.

Typical installation can be done directly from SuperCollider as a Quark:

`Quarks.install("https://github.com/SCLOrkHub/SCLOrkPieces/")`

Some of the folders are pointers to other github repositories.

git submodule update --init
